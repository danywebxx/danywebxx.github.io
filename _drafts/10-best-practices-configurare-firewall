When configuring and applying an ACL, be aware of the guidelines summarized in this list:
Create an ACL globally and then apply it.
Ensure the last statement is an implicit deny any or deny ip any any.
Remember that statement order is important because ACLs are processed top-down.
As soon as a statement is matched the ACL is exited.
Always filter from the most specific to the most generic. For example, deny a specific host and then permit all other hosts.
Remember that only one ACL is allowed per interface, per protocol, per direction.
Remember that new statements for an existing ACL are added to the bottom of the ACL by default.
Remember that router-generated packets are not filtered by outbound ACLs.
Place standard ACLs as close to the destination as possible.
Place extended ACLs as close to the source as possible.
L’ultima ma la più importante:
non chiuderti MAI FUORI!!!
